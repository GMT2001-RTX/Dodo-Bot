$title[About Canary]
$addField[Introduction;Canary is a way to test pre-release builds of upcoming versions of Dodo-Bot before they eventually release as a stable version.

Builds released in this state are incomplete and may have bugs as a result, so it is not recommended to use them for production purposes.
]
$addField[How to test?;For those who want to host them on their bots. You can download the files from the $hyperlink[canary-rebase;https://github.com/ddodogames/Dodo-Bot/tree/canary-rebase] branch on Github.

As of now, the official alpha bot for the rebase version is not available yet.
